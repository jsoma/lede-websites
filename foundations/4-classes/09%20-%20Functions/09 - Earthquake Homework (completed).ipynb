    "\n",
    "Be careful that you're doing all of your math with ints or floats instead of strings that look like ints or floats.\n",
    "When you write your functions, you can pass either the entire dictionary to the function OR just the part you're curious about (e.g., when you're getting the day you could send the whole earthquake dictionary or just what's in the 'time' key.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing empty functions that always return the same thing are a great way to start off. You can start saying every earthquake is shallow and then fill in the actual code later.\n",
    "\n",
