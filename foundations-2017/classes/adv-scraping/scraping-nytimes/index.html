  <article class="post-content">
    <h1 id="scraping-httpswwwnytimescom">Scraping: https://www.nytimes.com/</h1>

<p>Let’s try to scrape the frontpage of the NYT. We’re looking for</p>

<ul>
  <li>Headlines</li>
  <li>Bylines</li>
  <li>Article links</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>We’ll start by <strong>importing the necessary libraries</strong>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">requests</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">bs4</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">BeautifulSoup</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And then move into <strong>downloading the page</strong> and <strong>importing it into
BeautifulSoup</strong>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">requests</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'http://www.nytimes.com'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">doc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">BeautifulSoup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'html.parser'</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>A lot of people call the analyzed page variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">soup</code> but for once in my life I
actually go against the popular thing - I like to call it <code class="highlighter-rouge">doc</code>, since it helps
me remember that it’s the <em>entire document</em>.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-one-grabbing-the-tags-directly">ATTEMPT ONE: Grabbing the tags directly</h2>

<p>Let’s jump right into trying to grab the link.</p>

<p>Oh, look it’s an…. <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> tag. No special class or anything. What if we try to
get all of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> tags on the page?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="n">links</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">doc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'a'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Okay, that’s terrible. Do you know how many <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> tags are going to be on that
page? Many many many. Many very useless ones.</p>

<h2 id="talking-to-parents">Talking to parents</h2>

<p>When you can’t uniquely identify something, sometimes you need to go up the tree
to find its <strong>parent</strong>, the elements that are above it. We’ll be looking for an
element that covers the <strong>entire story</strong>, then we’ll pick the link out of it.</p>

<p>Great, it looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;article class="story theme-summary lede" id="topnews-100000004994965" data- story-id="100000004994965" data-rank="0" data-collection-renderstyle="LedeSum"&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I’m going to go out on a limb and say we should look for an <code class="highlighter-rouge">article</code> tag, but
what about the class? <code class="highlighter-rouge">story theme-summary lede</code> gives us three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">story</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">theme-summary</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">lede</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">story</code> sounds promising, yeah?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="n">story</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">doc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'article'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s">'class'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'story'</span> <span class="p">})</span>

<p>Seems to work well enough! Now that we have a parent, <strong>we can use that parent
to grab the elements inside of the story.</strong> We’ll use <code class="highlighter-rouge">.find</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.find_all</code> to
get everything we need.</p>

<ul>
  <li>STEP ONE: Get the story</li>
  <li>STEP TWO: Get the headline</li>
  <li>STEP THREE: Get the byline</li>
  <li>STEP FOUR: Get the link</li>
</ul>

<p>If we examine the page, it looks like headlines might be <code class="highlighter-rouge">h2</code> tags that have a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">story-heaing</code> class.</p>

<p>Hm, a story missing a headline? Let’s look at it a little closer. We could do
this in a classy way, but let’s just brute force it by print out every article
just before the error line.</p>
